# GNU General Public License

_Version 3, 29 June 2007_  _Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<http://fsf.org/>&gt;_

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this licensedocument, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and otherkinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take awayyour freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of aprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the FreeSoftware Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; itapplies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it toyour programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our GeneralPublic Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distributecopies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive sourcecode or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights orasking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities ifyou distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities torespect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must makesure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them theseterms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assertcopyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permissionto copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there isno warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPLrequires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will notbe attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions ofthe software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentallyincompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. Thesystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals touse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designedthis version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problemsarise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision tothose domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom ofusers.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States shouldnot allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purposecomputers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patentsapplied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, theGPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds ofworks, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under thisLicense. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work ina fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. Theresulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or awork “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based onthe Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement underapplicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a privatecopy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables otherparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computernetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to theextent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is nowarranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), thatlicensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of thisLicense. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as amenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

### 1. Source Code

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of awork.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfacesspecified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used amongdevelopers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other thanthe work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a MajorComponent, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only toenable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a StandardInterface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on whichthe executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object codeinterpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all thesource code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the objectcode and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools orgenerally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing thoseactivities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Sourceincludes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, andthe source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the workis specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication orcontrol flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerateautomatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

### 2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on theProgram, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This Licenseexplicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. Theoutput from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rightsof fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, withoutconditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey coveredworks to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusivelyfor you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that youcomply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do notcontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do soexclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibitthem from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationshipwith you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditionsstated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under anyapplicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treatyadopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumventionof such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention oftechnological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercisingrights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim anyintention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumventionof technological measures.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in anymedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License andany non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keepintact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy ofthis License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offersupport or warranty protection for a fee.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it fromthe Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided thatyou also meet all of these conditions:

* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving arelevant date.* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under thisLicense and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies therequirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone whocomes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with anyapplicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license thework in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you haveseparately received it.* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate LegalNotices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not displayAppropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which arenot by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined withit such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distributionmedium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resultingcopyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's usersbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregatedoes not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under theterms of this License, in one of these ways:

* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including aphysical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on adurable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including aphysical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at leastthree years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support forthat product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy ofthe Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by thisLicense, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, fora price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying ofsource, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at nocharge.* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer toprovide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally andnoncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, inaccord with subsection 6b.* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or fora charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same waythrough the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copythe Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the objectcode is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to findthe Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfythese requirements.* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you informother peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are beingoffered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from theCorresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying theobject code work.

A “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, whichmeans any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, orhousehold purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into adwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful casesshall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by aparticular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use ofthat class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the wayin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, theproduct. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product hassubstantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses representthe only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and executemodified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version ofits Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continuedfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered withsolely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically foruse in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in whichthe right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipientin perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction ischaracterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must beaccompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply ifneither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object codeon the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement tocontinue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has beenmodified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has beenmodified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itselfmaterially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rulesand protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord withthis section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with animplementation available to the public in source code form), and must require nospecial password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

### 7. Additional Terms

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additionalpermissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though theywere included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicablelaw. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may beused separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed bythis License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove anyadditional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additionalpermissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when youmodify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to acovered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to acovered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)supplement the terms of this License with terms:

* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms ofsections 15 and 16 of this License; or* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or authorattributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by workscontaining it; or* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring thatmodified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from theoriginal version; or* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of thematerial; or* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,trademarks, or service marks; or* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyonewho conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions ofliability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptionsdirectly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “furtherrestrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you receivedit, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this Licensealong with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If alicense document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveyingunder this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms ofthat license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive suchrelicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, inthe relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to thosefiles, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of aseparately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements applyeither way.

### 8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided underthis License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and willautomatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licensesgranted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from aparticular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until thecopyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable meansprior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanentlyif the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, thisis the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for anywork) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days afteryour receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses ofparties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If yourrights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify toreceive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of theProgram. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence ofusing peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not requireacceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission topropagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do notaccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, youindicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a licensefrom the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to thisLicense. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with thisLicense.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of anorganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, ormerging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entitytransaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work alsoreceives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had orcould give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessorhas it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted oraffirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may notinitiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) allegingthat any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, orimporting the Program or any portion of it.

### 11. Patents

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thuslicensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned orcontrolled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, thatwould be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, orselling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringedonly as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. Forpurposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patentsublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent licenseunder the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributorversion.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any expressagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as anexpress permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patentinfringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to makesuch an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and theCorresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of chargeand under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server orother readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the CorrespondingSource to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of thepatent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent withthe requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstreamrecipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, butfor the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or yourrecipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or moreidentifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, youconvey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patentlicense to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patentlicense you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work andworks based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within thescope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on thenon-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under thisLicense. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement witha third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you makepayment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying thework, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receivethe covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection withcopies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that containthe covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent licensewas granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any impliedlicense or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to youunder applicable patent law.

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from theconditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfysimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinentobligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if youagree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying fromthose to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those termsand this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link orcombine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU AfferoGeneral Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the coveredwork, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNUGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spiritto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies thata certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any laterversion” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by theFree Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNUGeneral Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the FreeSoftware Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNUGeneral Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of aversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, noadditional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result ofyour choosing to follow a later version.

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIESPROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHEREXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OFMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THEQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVEDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

### 16. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANYCOPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM ASPERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THEPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATEOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATEWITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THEPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot begiven local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply locallaw that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability inconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompaniesa copy of the Program in return for a fee.

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

The hypothetical commands `show w` and `show c` should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, tosign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program intoproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider itmore useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this iswhat you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of thisLicense. But first, please read&lt;<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>&gt;.
