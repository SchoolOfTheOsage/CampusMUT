## Inspiration

With Tyler Technologies exiting the SIS market in 2025 and many Missouri schools migrating to Infinite Campus, there is an unmet desire for the equivalent of the the Data Grid and Groupings, in particular editing in the data grid, and Flat File Import tools that Tyler SISK12 had. This tool aims to fill this desire.
